Things we are working on:

1.  Information/Resources and Links to leverage the top 3 to 6 Industrial IDS vendors online demos they provide.

2.  Details about running PCAP Analysis offline to learn how SCADA/DCS/ICS/OT traffic looks in the wild.

3.  Details about how to set up a home ICS lab (this can get expensive and we will try to show lowest cost options).

4.  Always looking for more tools and resources from around the web.
